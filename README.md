# Personality-Prediction-Based-On-Handwriting-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning

##### [This is project is still under optimization. This can be considered as MVP]

Handwriting analysis is a method of understanding the individuality of a person based on the handwriting of that particular person. The comprehensive personality of every individual person is portrayed by the brain. This neurological pattern of the brain produces unique movement. When a person writes, subconsciously strokes, patterns & pressures are applied which can reveal that individual's personality.

In this application user can scan the handwriting of a particular individual and that image will get preprocessed in the backend and it will also extract the needed data from that image. Once this process is done, this data will be given to a machine learning model which will predict the personality & characteristics of the author.

## GRAPHOLOGY

From the early day of the world war to nowadays in hiring, student counseling, criminal mind analysis, etc, graphology is being in use by professionals.

Analyzing handwriting is a area of psychological study based on that one can do personality prediction. This process demands time and lot of experiences which also includes repetition of same procedure. Having an smart application ( Mobile App ) can help to achieve this task in minutes. The main goal of this application is to provide a better approach towards the area of study where one can encapsulate the study of computer science with psychology.
